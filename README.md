## What Is This Bot?

This bot trades **Polymarket 15-minute Up/Down prediction markets** for **Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP**. It uses a **pre-order arbitrage strategy**: it places limit buy orders on **both** the Up and Down tokens before or at the start of each 15-minute period. If both orders fill at or below your limit price, you are guaranteed a small profit at resolution (one side pays $1 per share). The bot also includes **signal-based risk management** (when to place orders, when to skip, when to sell early) and **automatic redemption** when markets resolve.

**Use cases:** automated market-making on Polymarket 15m crypto markets, hedging both outcomes, and capturing edge when Up and Down can both be bought below 0.50 combined.

---

## How Does the Bot Work?

### High-Level Flow

1. **Period alignment**  
   The bot uses **15-minute periods** in **Eastern Time (ET)**, aligned to :00, :15, :30, and :45 (e.g. 2:00, 2:15, 2:30, 2:45).

2. **Market discovery**  
   For each asset (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP), markets are found by **slug** in the form:
   - `btc-updown-15m-{timestamp}`
   - `eth-updown-15m-{timestamp}`
   - `sol-updown-15m-{timestamp}`
   - `xrp-updown-15m-{timestamp}`  
   The `timestamp` is the **period start** (Unix seconds). The bot discovers the **current** and **next** period markets via the Polymarket Gamma API.

3. **Pre-orders for the next period**  
   When the time until the **next** 15m period is less than or equal to `place_order_before_mins` (e.g. 2–3 minutes), the bot:
   - Optionally evaluates a **signal** on the **current** market (see [Strategy Logic](#strategy-logic-in-detail)).
   - If the signal is **Good**, it looks up the **next** period market by slug and places **limit buy** orders on both **Up** and **Down** at your configured `price_limit` (e.g. 0.45).
   - If the signal is **Bad**, it **skips** placing pre-orders for the next period.

4. **After orders are placed**  
   - The bot periodically checks whether orders have **filled** (via CLOB API in production, or price vs limit in simulation).
   - It maintains **per-asset state**: which orders are filled, expiry time, and whether it has already sold one side or redeemed.

5. **When both sides are filled**  
   - If one side’s **sell price** rises above `sell_opposite_above` (e.g. 0.84) **and** the time remaining in the period is ≤ `sell_opposite_time_remaining` minutes, the bot **sells the losing side** (market sell) and **holds the winning side** to resolution.
   - At resolution, the winning token pays **$1 per share**; the bot **redeems** that position automatically (or you can use the redeem CLI).

6. **One side filled only (risk management)**  
   If only **Up** or only **Down** is filled, the bot can **sell that side** and **cancel** the other order to limit loss:
   - **Price-based:** sell when the matched token’s price falls to or below `danger_price`.
   - **Time-based:** sell after `danger_time_passed` minutes with only one side filled.

7. **Mid-market orders (optional)**  
   If `mid_market_enabled` is true and there is enough time left in the **current** period, the bot may place **limit orders on the current** market (not just the next one), using dynamic prices derived from current Up/Down prices.

8. **Resolution and redemption**  
   A background task runs every `market_closure_check_interval_seconds`. When a market is **closed** and the bot holds a winning position, it **redeems** the winning tokens and updates PnL.

## Supported Markets

| Asset | Slug pattern        | Example                    |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| BTC   | `btc-updown-15m-{ts}`  | `btc-updown-15m-1771007400` |
| ETH   | `eth-updown-15m-{ts}`  | `eth-updown-15m-1771007400` |
| SOL   | `sol-updown-15m-{ts}`  | `sol-updown-15m-1771007400` |
| XRP   | `xrp-updown-15m-{ts}`  | `xrp-updown-15m-1771007400` |

The bot runs the same logic **in parallel** for all four assets. Each asset has its own state (orders, fills, expiry).

---

## Features

- **Multi-asset 15m support:** BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP in one process.
- **Pre-order strategy:** Limit buys on both Up and Down before/at period start.
- **High-Speed Oracle:** Integration with Binance Websockets for real-time price monitoring of multiple assets.
- **Advanced Signal Logic:** Good/Bad/Unknown signal using front-running and correlation (BTC dominance/movements).
- **Fractional Kelly Criterion:** Dynamic sizing based on equity and edge to optimize long-term bankroll growth.
- **Deterministic State Machine:** Robust cycle management focused on 15-minute intervals.
- **Sell-opposite logic:** When both filled, sell the losing side if the winner’s price is high and time is short.
- **One-side risk management:** Price-based or time-based early exit when only one side fills.
- **Real-time PnL & CSV Auditing:** Systematic logging of all trades to `trades.csv` for post-resolution analysis.
- **Simulation mode:** Run without placing real orders; match logic based on price vs limit.
- **Automatic redemption:** Redeem winning positions when markets resolve.
- **Redeem CLI:** Manual redeem by condition ID or fetch all redeemable positions for your proxy wallet.

---

## Advanced Signals & Correlation

The bot utilizes a dedicated **Binance Oracle** that tracks real-time price action via high-speed websockets. This feed is used for:

- **BTC Correlation**: Monitoring Bitcoin movements to predict or front-run moves in ETH, SOL, and XRP markets.
- **Front-running Signals**: Evaluating when a market might "clear" or move significantly before the period ends, allowing the bot to skip risky entry windows.
- **Market Dominance**: Assessing current market stability across multiple assets to determine signal quality (Good/Bad).

---

## Position Sizing & Risk Management

Rather than fixed trade sizes, the bot implements a **Fractional Kelly Criterion** approach:

1.  **Bankroll-aware**: Sizes are calculated based on your `bankroll_usdc`.
2.  **Fractional Kelly (k)**: A multiplier (default 0.25) to manage volatility and risk of ruin.
3.  **Risk Aversion (Gamma)**: Controls the sensitivity of the sizing algorithm to perceived edge.
4.  **Max Exposure**: Protects against placing too many orders at once across different assets.

---

## Auditing & PnL Tracking

Every activity is recorded for full transparency:

- **`trades.csv`**: Contains a structured record of every trade, including market ID, token (Up/Down), side, price, filled amount, and PnL.
- **Post-Resolution Logging**: The bot automatically recovers resolution data (final payout) to calculate real-world profit/loss.
- **Terminal Summary**: Real-time updates on current period and total session PnL are displayed in the console.

---


## Requirements

- **Rust** 1.70+ (`rustup` recommended).
- **Polymarket API credentials:** API key, secret, passphrase (for CLOB), and optionally a **private key** + **proxy wallet** for signing and redemption.
- **Network:** Access to Polymarket Gamma API and CLOB (default endpoints in config).

## Usage

### Run the bot (live or simulation)

```bash
# Use default config.json
./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot

# Custom config path
./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot --config /path/to/config.json
```

Set `strategy.simulation_mode` to `true` in config to run without placing real orders.

### Redeem winning positions

```bash
# Redeem a specific condition (condition_id in hex, with or without 0x prefix)
./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot --redeem --condition-id 0x...

# Fetch all redeemable positions for proxy_wallet_address and redeem them
./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot --redeem
```

`--redeem` requires `proxy_wallet_address` in config.

### Logging

Log level is controlled by the `RUST_LOG` environment variable (e.g. `info`, `debug`).

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot
```

## Strategy Logic in Detail

- **Good signal:** Up and Down prices in the current market are within `stable_min`–`stable_max`, and no “clear” condition (e.g. one side ≥ `clear_threshold` with little time left). → Bot may place pre-orders for next period and (if enabled) mid-market orders on current period.
- **Bad signal:** Clear condition met (e.g. one side very high near period end). → Bot skips pre-orders for the **next** 15m period.
- **Both filled:** If winner’s sell price ≥ `sell_opposite_above` and minutes remaining ≤ `sell_opposite_time_remaining`, sell the loser, hold winner to resolution, then redeem.
- **One side filled:** Depending on `one_side_buy_risk_management`, sell the matched side when price ≤ `danger_price` or after `danger_time_passed` minutes, and cancel the other order.

All times are based on the **current 15-minute period** in ET; market slugs follow the `{asset}-updown-15m-{timestamp}` convention used by Polymarket 15m markets.
